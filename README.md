Fantasy BnE is a full-stack web application inspired by [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com). To implement its listing, review, and file features, the applicatoin uses technologies including Rails, PostgreSQL, React.js, Redux, and AWS S3 storage. The project was designed, implemented, and seen in most of its current state over a span of 10 days. Though the current application is a simplified version of its inspiration-- it will gain more features over time.
